 ## Data cleaning and preprocessing 
1. The dataset is read from a CSV file using Pandas.
2. Certain characters like ,, â‚¹, and % are removed from the discounted_price, actual_price, discount_percentage, and rating_count columns to convert them to numeric values.
3. The rating column contains a character | which is replaced by 4 to convert it to a float.
4. Duplicated data is checked and removed if present.
5. The category column is preprocessed to remove extra information and symbols like &.

 ## Exploratory Data analysis

 The EDA comprises several visualizations to gain insights from the data:
 *Products Demand in Price Range*: A strip plot showing the demand for products in different price ranges 
  for each category.
 *Ratings of Products In Categories*: A box plot showing the distribution of product ratings in different 
 categories.
 *Top Discount Percentage Categories*: A bar plot displaying the categories with the highest discount 
 percentages.
 *Total Sales of Categories*: A bar plot showing the total sales of products in different categories.
 *Correlation Matrix*: A heatmap displaying the correlation between different variables in the dataset.
 *Pairplot*: A pair plot showing the relationships between 'sales', 'actual_price', 'discounted_price', and 
 'rating_count'.
 
   ## Conclusion
  The EDA provides valuable insights into Amazon sales data, including trends in product demand, ratings, 
  and discounts. The visualizations help understand customer preferences and the performance of different 
  product categories. Feel free to explore the Jupyter Notebook to dig deeper into the analysis and
